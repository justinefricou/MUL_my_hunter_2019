A small video game based on the rules of Duck Hunt:
You are a wizard summoned by a Lord to help him besiege a castle.
Your mission is to prevent your ennemies from reaching out for help by killing the carrier pigeons they send.
The pigeons appear on the screen and move from one side to another. You can click on them to cast a spell and kill them.
